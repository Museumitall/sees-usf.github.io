		<strong>Specification mining for system-on-chip design validation</strong>
		
		<p style="font-size:1.3vw; line-height:1.5">
		Comprehensive and well-defined specifications are necessary to perform rigorous and thorough validation of 
		system-on-chip~(SoC) designs. However, in practice such specifications are usually not available, often 
		ambiguous, incomplete, or even contain errors. Moreover, as a SoC design gradually progresses across design
		stages, the connection between the original specifications and the design implementation may become imprecise
		and disjoint. The specification problems may lead to potential misunder-standings of the design 
		behavior, introduce unintentional behavior into the design, and hinder effective and efficient validation process. 
		This project addresses that problem by developing automated methods to extract patterns from SoC execution 
		traces using data mining and machine learning techniques. The extracted patterns are served as specification 
		which can be used in SoC validation and debug.

				In this project, we try to address the <strong>state space explosion</strong> problem often encountered during model checking systems of high concurrency. The central idea behind our research is divide-n-conquer, <em>i.e.</em>, verification of an entire system is inferred by results from verification of consisting components.
