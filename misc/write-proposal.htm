The following elements are used when a proposal is reviewed by the NSF, therefore, a successful proposal must explicitly address all of them.
<ol>
  <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
      <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
    </ol>
  <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>

  <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?</li>
  <li>Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
  <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
  <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
</ol>

In the proposal, try to use statements or sentences that reviewers can use to write his/her reviews. 
An example proposal summary is shown below.
  
  <p>
  The <strong>intellectual merit</strong> of the project is its transformational approach, which integrates
  modeling the fate of a micropollutant in a biological process with a fundamental co-substrate mechanism, 
  bioselector design effects, and microbial composition based on molecular methods. A second potential far 
  reaching benefit will be the development of pure cultures capable of EE2 degradation under conditions similar 
  to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for future kinetic and genetic studies, and development of qPCR primer
  sets for monitoring select EE2-degrading heterotrophs in WWTP facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <strong>broader impacts</strong> of the project are benefits to society by providing a basis to optimize 
  WWTP biotreatment design to minimize estrogen release to the environment. Direct educational benefits include
  the training of graduate students, and participation of undergraduate researchers. Increased participation by 
  under-represented groups will be realized through established university programs and continued partnership 
  with the Office of Diversity.
