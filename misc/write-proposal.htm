The following elements are used when a proposal is reviewed by the NSF, therefore, a successful proposal must explicitly address all of them.
<ol>
  <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
      <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
    </ol>
  <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>

  <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?</li>
  <li>Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
  <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
  <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
</ol>
