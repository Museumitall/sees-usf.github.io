<section><h2>General Elements and Organization of a Proposal<h2>
Some key elements are commonly included in the organization of a proposal.  First, it should describe one of the following things to motivate the proposal.
  <ol>
    <li>
      Goal statements -- general statements of a project's ultimate goals, which are broad, idealistic, and visionary. Examples:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Our goal with this project is to improve the teaching of STEM subjects to undergraduates
        </li>
        <li>
          This research will develop an analytical framework for classifying the learning styles of middle students
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Hypothesis: a specific, testable assumption or conjecture that research data are expected to support. Examples:
      <oL>
        <li>
          We will test the hypothesis that large neurons are selectively destroyed in Alzhemers Disease by measureing the sizes of ganglion cells in retinas of AD patients compared with those in control groups.      
        </li>
        <li>
          We hypothesize that increaed consumption of omega-3 seafood, fresh fruits and vegetables will reduce the progression of cognitive impairment in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Research questions: inquiries related to lack of knowledge in an important area of research, asnswers to which are sought through the research design.  Research questions may be viewed as hypotheses posed as quesitons. Examples:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Are there significant variations in standards of practice among physicians?
        </li>
        <li>
          Are there common lifestyle traits among those suffering from diabetes in this region?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
<p>
  <strong>Objectives</strong>: specific, measurable outcomes, milestones, and benchmarks to be achieved in moving toward the project goal.
  <ol>
    <li>
      Some objectives need to follow the goals, hypothesis, or research questions raised at the beginning to indicate what will be produced.  Completion of objectives will lead to the goals to be achieved. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Objectives can be (1) products like tools, teaching kits, etc, (2) a process or methodology, e.g. design and test three new modules for teaching economics to undergraduate, (3) performance, (4) behavioral, e.g. this treatment will enable patients to learn to walk with extenal support. 
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
  </section>
  
<section> <h2>NSF Proposal</h2>
The following elements are used when a proposal is reviewed by the NSF, therefore, a successful proposal must explicitly address all of them.
<ol>
  <li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
      <li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
    </ol>
  <li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>

  <li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale?</li>
  <li>Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
  <li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
  <li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?</li>
</ol>
  
  <strong>Intellectual Merits</strong><br>
  <ol>
    <li>Important/significance of the project</li>
    <li>Qualitification of PIs</li>
    <li>Creativity/originality/innovation/transformative potential of the methods and approaches -- e.g. move the field into a new direction (transformative), 
      or advance the state-of-the-art in a novel and innovative way.  Some example descriptions: 
      <em>"There are potentially transformative apsects of the proposed work, which if successful could ..."</em>, 
      or, <em>"These activities are potentailly transformative because ..."</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      Well-conceived and organized methods and approaches
    </li>
    <li>
      Resource adaquacy
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <strong>Broader Impacts</strong><br>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching and learning
      <ul>
      <li>
        Develop and contribute educational materials based on your research that you can include in a teaching database like a K-16 digital library;
      </li>
      <li>
        Involve K-12, undergraduate or graduate students as participants in your research;
      </li>
			<li>
				Integrate your project activities into K-12, undergraduate and graduate teaching of science, math and
engineering;
			</li>
			<li>
				Collaborate with educators and researchers to incorporate your research into learning and education;
			</li>
			<li>
					Involve your graduate and post-doctoral student researchers in undergraduate teaching activities;
			</li>
			<li>
				Invite student teams involved in your research to make presentations to professional societies;
			</li>
			<li>
				Establish mentoring programs for high school, undergraduate and graduate students, as well as research
technicians; or
			</li>
			<li>
				Involve your team and your project activities in the recruitment, training or professional development of K-12 math and science teachers.
			</li>	
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Promote participation of under-represented groups</li>
    <li>Enhance infrastructure for research and education</li>
    <li>Broad dissemination</li>
    <li>Societal benefits beyond the directly related technical field</li>
  </ol>
  
In the proposal, try to use statements or sentences that reviewers can use to write his/her reviews. 
An example proposal summary is shown below.
  
  <p>
  The <strong>intellectual merit</strong> of the project is its transformational approach, which integrates
  modeling the fate of a micropollutant in a biological process with a fundamental co-substrate mechanism, 
  bioselector design effects, and microbial composition based on molecular methods. A second potential far 
  reaching benefit will be the development of pure cultures capable of EE2 degradation under conditions similar 
  to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for future kinetic and genetic studies, and development of qPCR primer
  sets for monitoring select EE2-degrading heterotrophs in WWTP facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <strong>broader impacts</strong> of the project are benefits to society by providing a basis to optimize 
  WWTP biotreatment design to minimize estrogen release to the environment. Direct educational benefits include
  the training of graduate students, and participation of undergraduate researchers. Increased participation by 
  under-represented groups will be realized through established university programs and continued partnership 
  with the Office of Diversity.
