  	Increasing computing capability is a key enabler for many emerging applications as 
  	exemplified by smart healthy, smart city, smart building, smart transportation, autonomous driving, etc.
  	Functions and services offered by those applications are increasingly enhanced by integrating 
  	more computer hardware and software code. For example, a typical consumer vehicle sold today 
  	is typically installed with >10M lines of software code.  The projection is that even more
  	software will be integrated in the future.  Another trend is that more and more individual devices 
  	are being connected each day to offer better services, safety, and efficiency.  
  	We can envision that the entire world is a big connected network of computing devices that
  	perform diverse tasks.     
  	</p>
  	
  	<p>
  	Along with all benefits from ever growing network of connected devices with more powerful
  	computing capabilities come various challenges.  First, security has been and will become even
  	bigger problem as many devices we experience everyday have critical impact on our well beings 
  	if they have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious parties.  Second, as the scale of 
  	connected computing devices is getting larger, and the need to integrate more computing power into
  	miniaturized systems is growing, making computation be more efficient has high importance,  
  	Third, unlike traditional consumer applications where the typical life span of computing devices
  	is 2 -- 4 years, most current and future devices have significant physical aspects.  Those devices
  	are usually designed to last for a long period of time.  During such long life time, the operating
  	context and thus the missions originally designed for a device may change.  An important question 
  	is how to design a system that can evolve itself to adapt to ever changing environment.

    Our overall research objective is to address challenges as outlined above, and future challenges 
    brought by new applications or as results of new technologies.  
    My general research areas include computer architecture, embedded systems, VLSI design, and electronic 
design automation.  Currently, we are looking at hardware safety and security assurance 
by investigating various design time and runtime methods and techniques, application of machine learning in 
design automation, efficient hardware design of machine learning algorithms, and formal verification and 
	reasoning of hardware and software systems. 
    <p>
  	<strong>To interested students</strong>: dedicated and hardworking students are welcome to join us
  	to work on different projects addressing the above challenges.  When you contact us, please explain
  	briefly why you would like to apply, and why you are interested in the area of yoru choice.
